Here’s the **brutally realistic 6-month roadmap** that turns you from
**“junior frontend dev who’s scared of AI” → “applied AI engineer who can ship startup-level products.”**

No fluff, no garbage.
Just the exact sequence you need.

---

# **🔥 Month 1 — Core AI Engineering Foundations (No LangChain)**

Your only job this month is to understand the **primitives**.

### **1. Learn LLM API basics (JS/TS only)**

Be able to do these without thinking:

- Chat completion request
- Structured JSON output
- Function calling
- Streaming responses
- Error handling + retries

**Build mini-scripts:**

- format text
- generate ideas
- classify text
- extract fields

5–10 small scripts = huge confidence boost.

---

### **2. Learn Embeddings**

Understand:

- what embedding vectors are
- how similarity search works
- chunking logic
- vector norms

Practice with:

- OpenAI embeddings
- local vector search (e.g., Vercel AI SDK’s memory cache)
- Supabase or Pinecone

---

### **3. Learn Prompt Engineering (real version)**

Forget YouTube tricks.

Focus on:

- deterministic instructions
- role + goal + rules
- input → output format constraints
- hard-coded examples

Make outputs **consistent**, not “creative.”

---

# **🔥 Month 2 — RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) From Scratch**

This is where 99% of devs fail because they copy LangChain tutorials.
You’re not doing that.

### **Build RAG step-by-step:**

1. Upload file
2. Parse text
3. Split into chunks
4. Generate embeddings
5. Store in vector DB
6. Search by similarity
7. Build context
8. Ask LLM with context
9. Return structured answer

### **Your project for this month:**

> **"Upload any PDF → ask questions → get accurate answers."**

This becomes a portfolio center-piece.

---

# **🔥 Month 3 — Tool Calling & Multi-Step AI Workflows**

This month you learn what separates AI toys from real AI apps.

### **Learn:**

- OpenAI tool-calling
- Building functions that LLM can execute
- Multi-step orchestration
- Agent-like workflows (BUT WITHOUT LangChain)

### **Projects you will build:**

1. **Resume Analyzer**

   - Extract sections
   - Score experience
   - Suggest improvements

2. **Invoice → JSON structured parser**

   - Extract fields
   - Validate them
   - Store in DB

These build real-world hiring credibility fast.

---

# **🔥 Month 4 — Full-Stack AI Application Architecture**

Now you combine everything.

### **Learn backend patterns:**

- caching AI responses
- handling model fallbacks
- batching requests
- cost optimization
- token usage tracking
- API rate-limiting
- secure endpoints

### **Build a real AI product:**

> **AI Research Assistant**

- Search the web
- Summarize content
- Structure insights
- Save them
- Chat with collected data

This is basically a mini-startup.

---

# **🔥 Month 5 — Your Own AI Startup-Style Project**

This is where you switch from “learning” → “creating value.”

Pick one domain you like:

- trekking / travel
- productivity
- education
- finance
- health
- content creation

Then build a product with these core features:

- custom RAG
- tool-calling
- multi-step workflows
- dashboards
- authentication
- activity logs
- real-time streaming

**This becomes your flagship portfolio project.**

Example for your trekking domain:

> “AI Trip Planner + Safety Assistant”

- Takes user constraints
- Recommends itinerary
- Extracts info from PDF maps
- Alerts for weather issues
- Generates packing lists
- Suggests local guides

That is **startup-level**.

---

# **🔥 Month 6 — Interview Prep, Polishing, and Productization**

### **Tech Prep**

- system design for AI apps
- debugging AI pipelines
- testing LLM outputs
- optimizing eval loops

### **Portfolio Polishing**

You will have:

- 1 flagship project
- 2–3 medium AI apps
- 1 RAG system
- 10+ small scripts

### **Business Prep**

- convert your flagship AI app into SaaS
- add onboarding, billing, analytics
- launch on ProductHunt / Reddit
- gather feedback

### **Career Prep**

- refresh CV
- push to GitHub
- prepare take-home assignments
- apply to **AI-heavy SWE roles**

---

# **🔥 What you’ll become after 6 months**

Not a “frontend dev.”
Not a “junior.”

But a **full-stack applied AI engineer** who can:

- design AI pipelines
- build RAG
- use embeddings
- orchestrate multi-step workflows
- integrate vector DBs
- ship production-grade AI apps

That’s exactly the type of engineer everyone wants.

If you want, I can turn this into a **weekly schedule**, or I can help you pick your **flagship AI project** right now based on your strengths.
